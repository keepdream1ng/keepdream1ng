Hello👋,
I'm Anatolii Ivanov, and I've spent a decade 🗓️ designing and creating documentation for the fabrication and construction of industrial buildings 🏭.
Now, I'm eagerly excited to dive into building apps :computer:📱 first hand.

Technologies im used to as developer:
1. .NET C# with Visual Studio.
2. Git
3. Skilled enough at HTML, CSS, Javascript to build web apps with ASP.NET and (optionally) Blazor.
4. Beguiner at SQL.
5. Beguiner at Docker.

I like CLI and widely use vim emulators in .net stuff. I started updating my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anatolii-ivanov-b8619a253/) though is still mostly about civil engineering but along with learning web developement with
skillfactory i started building my "developer oriented" [website](https://keepdream1ng.github.io/keepdream1ng/). It's heavier in terms of words count than this resume, and i try out vanilla website building technics there.
