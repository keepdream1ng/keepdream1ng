Hello👋,
I'm Anatolii Ivanov, and I've spent a decade 🗓️ designing and creating documentation for the fabrication and construction of industrial buildings 🏭.
Now, I'm eagerly excited to dive into building apps :computer:📱 first hand.

Technologies im used to as developer:
1. .NET C# with Visual Studio.
2. Git
3. HTML, CSS, Javascript to build web apps with ASP.NET and (optionally) Blazor.
4. SQL.
5. Docker.

I post updates for projects on my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anatolii-ivanov-b8619a253/) and there you can see my civil engineering experience.

Along with learning web developement with Skillfactory I started building my "developer oriented" [website](https://keepdream1ng.github.io/keepdream1ng/).
It's heavier in terms of words count than this resume, and it is build without any library or framework just vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.
