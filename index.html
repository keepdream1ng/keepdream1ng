                        Hello! My name is Anatolii Ivanov,
                        and I have spent a decade designing
                        and creating documentation for the
                        fabrication and construction of industrial
                        buildings. Now, I'm extremely excited
                        to dive into building apps first hand.

                        I graduated in a very wide field of civil engineering

                        analysis and design, also with a strong drift for
                        improvement and automation. Degree: Specialist
                        (5 years, which is equal to Master's degree).

                        During my 10 year career office has been both
                        remote and upstairs from fabrication workshop.
                        I've been an only project author and managed
                        team of 2-3 modelers, 8+ drafters. Newer
                        hesitated to dive into new technology
                        to work more efficiently and satisfy
                        clients need under deadlines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also developed an efficient habits to
                        have more things done and be healthier.
                        It's especially important now, when I've
                        become a father.

                        Working under pressure of a real fabrication workshop,
                        made me super result oriented. If I know that we cant
                        make the task on time, I'll try to negotiate part that
                        absolutely nesessary to be the main focus, and will 
                        find parts of project what can be delivered after
                        fabrication workshop will get their workload from my team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surely being a father I value my time and prefer
                        to work smarter, not harder. Combine with an itch for
                        automation that made me want to study programming.
                        I really enjoy building systems that help to eluminate
                        bottlenecks in my, or someone else's work.

                        For now I have time to make projects what are part of Skillfactory
                        course and small apps what help me with my current job
                        in structural analysis (civil engineering), but I have intension to
                        get a pet project and figure out free cloud options for it.
                        And this site I started building at the same week we had html module,
                        so far it is sandbox for my ideas.
