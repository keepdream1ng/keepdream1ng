                    Hello! My name is Anatolii Ivanov,
                    and I have spent a decade designing
                    and creating documentation for the
                    fabrication and construction of industrial
                    buildings. Now, I'm extremely excited
                    to dive into building apps first hand.

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    I graduated in very wide field of civil engineering
                    but since very first job stayed on the path of 
                    analysis and design, also with a strong drift for
                    improvement and automation. Degree: Specialist
                    (5 years, whitch is equal to Master's degree).

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    During my 10 year carieer office has been both
                    remote and upstairs from fabrication workshop.
                    I've been an only project author and managed
                    team of 2-3 modelers, 8+ drafters. Newer
                    hesitated to dive into new techonology
                    to work more efficiently and satisfy
                    clients need under deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also developed an efficient habbits to
                    have more things done and be healthier.
                    It's especially important now, when I've
                    become a father.

                <h3>Values</h3>
                <p>
                    Working under pressure of a real fabrication workshop,
                    made me super result oriented. If I know that we cant
                    make the task on time, I'll try to negotiate part that
                    absolutely nesessary to be the main focus, and will 
                    find parts of project what can be delivered after
                    fabrication workshop will get their workload from my team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surely being a father I value my time and prefer
                    to work smarter, not harder. Combine with an itch for
                    automation that made me want to study programming.
                    I really enjoy building systems that help to eluminate
                    bottlenecks in my, or someone else work.
