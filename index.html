                        Hello. My name is Anatolii Ivanov, and for over 10 years,
                        I have been involved in developing documentation for the
                        construction of industrial facilities that operate
                        successfully in various geographical zones.
                        Now, I want to build the structure and logic of applications
                        in the digital space.

                        During my 10-year career as a structural-designer, I have experience
                        in both remote work and direct oversight of the workshop
                        where metal structures were manufactured according to my drawings.

                    <p>
                        From my first job placement, I aimed to improve productivity.
                        With the tools available to a design engineer, I developed
                        tools to simplify calculations and project documentation.
                        This allowed me not only to remain the author of projects
                        but also to optimize the working process for the entire
                        team of steel-designers and draftsmen.

                        Over this time, I have developed several habits to improve
                        productivity and physical and emotional health:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Polyphasic sleep: It allows me to recharge during
                                a 20-minute lunch break.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Daily exercise: It maintains my physical fitness and memory.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The ability to work both sitting and standing: It provides frequent breaks throughout the day.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, since I began learning programming, I have
                        mastered ten finger typing and am ready to explore new skills.
                        All of these habits help me not only in my professional development
                        but also free up extra time for raising my daughter,
                        as I have become a father.

                        <p>
                            As the lead design engineer at the factory, I understood that the
                            continuous operation of the production depends on the project documentation I deliver. If the deadlines set for the project department did not align with their capabilities, I always found ways to ensure the factory at least partially met the production demands for necessary metal products at the construction site.
                        </p>
                        <li>
                            Striving for efficiency.
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            I prefer to come up with solutions to reduce task execution time.
                            It was precisely the desire to automate any process that led me
                            to study programming.
                            I really enjoy creating systems that help to eluminate
                            bottlenecks in mine, or someone else's work.
